# Sorting Visualisation
This Java program visualizes sorting algorithms using a graphical interface built with Swing. It allows users to see the sorting process in real-time with adjustable delay between sorting steps.
## Features
- **Graphical Visualization:** Visual representation of sorting process using colored bars.
- **Adjustable Delay:** Control the speed of the sorting process using a slider.
- **Time Measurement:** Displays the time taken to complete the sorting process.
## How It Works
The program generates an array of random integers and visualizes the sorting process using different colors for each bar. Users can start the sorting process by clicking a button, and the time taken for sorting is displayed in a label at the bottom.
